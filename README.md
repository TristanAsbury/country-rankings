# 🌍 Country Ranker
A sleek, accessible, and responsive country ranking app built with React, Tailwind CSS, and React Aria components, powered by the REST Countries API.

### ✨ What I Built & Learned:

- Smooth UI/UX – Leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling and React Aria for accessibility.
- State Management – Keeping things fast and interactive with React hooks.
- API Integration – Parsing and structuring data from the REST Countries API.
- Built this as a fun way to explore global data while sharpening my frontend skills. Try it out and see how different countries compare! 🚀
